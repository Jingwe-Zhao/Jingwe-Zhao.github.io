I'm a Ph.D. candidate :student: in Physiology at Xiamen University School of Medicine. My research focuses on the intersection of bioinformatics :computer: and reproductive medicine :pregnant_woman:, leveraging computational approaches to address key challenges in reproductive health.

Premature birth and pregnancy maintenance
======
Premature birth (<37 weeks :hourglass_flowing_sand: ) results from disrupted pregnancy maintenance mechanisms, including progesterone signaling, immune tolerance, and cervical integrity. Common triggers include infection, placental dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Current research focuses on identifying biomarkers, developing therapies, and extending gestation :clock3: to address this global health challenge.


Single-cell transcriptomics
======
Recent single-cell omics studies, especially by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, have greatly advanced our understandings of the immune cell subpopulations and the features of reproductive-associated stromal cells at single-cell level. These studies have yielded novel insights into reproductive development and pregnancy processes. However, the scRNA-seq technology still has limitations. The most critical point is that the spatial and morphologic information is lost after the tissue dissociation into single-cell suspension, making it hard to investigate the reproductive-associated cells spatial architecture.


Spatial transcriptomics
======
The recently developed spatial transcriptomics (ST) technology could overcome the above limitations. By positioning histological cryosections on arrayed reverse transcription primers with unique positional barcodes, ST provides high-quality genome-wide transcriptome data with intact two-dimensional positional information. Currently, the leading ST platforms include 10x Genomics Visium HD [Learn more](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/visium)  and BGI Stereo-seq [Learn more](https://www.stomics.tech/) ,etc. 


Spatial metabolomics
======
Space metabolomics, as an emerging and rapidly developing discipline, combines mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technology and metabolomics technology, providing a new perspective and powerful tools for research in the field of life sciences. Space metabolomics can achieve high-precision and high-throughput quantitative analysis of metabolites in cells, tissues, and organs by combining mass spectrometry imaging technology and high-throughput omics technology, helping us to comprehensively understand the complexity of metabolic networks and the interactions between metabolites [Learn more](https://www.oebiotech.com/kjdxzx/scatam-seq.html).



Multi-Omics Approaches for Preterm Birth Research
------
Multi-omics technologies provide powerful tools to investigate the complex mechanisms of preterm birth. Single-cell RNA sequencing enables high-resolution characterization of cellular heterogeneity at the maternal-fetal interface, while spatial transcriptomics preserves the tissue architecture to map gene expression patterns in situ. When combined with spatial metabolomics that profiles local metabolic microenvironments, these approaches allow comprehensive analysis of the molecular and cellular interactions underlying pregnancy maintenance and preterm labor. Integration of these multi-omics data can identify key pathogenic pathways, discover predictive biomarkers, and reveal potential therapeutic targets for preventing preterm birth. This systems biology approach offers new opportunities to understand and intervene in preterm birth through simultaneous examination of cellular, spatial, and metabolic dimensions.
